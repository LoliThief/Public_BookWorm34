The main purpose of our project is to help people develop themselves more effectively, mainly foster the strengths and circumvent the weaknesses of their personality. This is achieved by accumulating a database of books which are beneficial for people with certain strengths, the database is dynamic as it incorporates every userâ€™s feedback. First version of the database was comprised by a couple of volunteers who we invited to read the materials offered by "Bookworm34". Initially, not all results were perfect, but after several iterations of updating after receiving feedback, the results became very accurate. 
The aforementioned weaknesses and strengths of personality are identified using the CliftonStrengths assessment developed and perfected by Gallup University over the course of 70 years. The scope of our project is limitless, because it helps each user to find his place in society, as well as perform his duties extremely efficiently.
